Wednesdat 8/31/16 -- Work on modules; Screenshare meeting at night(?) to discuss progress; Decide whether to submit draft2;

This is a test using vim editor in git bash.

to use this  feature, navigate to your team-D-automation directory and type the  following: vim 'hello Team D!.txt' ---------then press enter
this will open up the vim editor. the txt file will now display in your git bash.
next push the 'i' key for insert. you can now navigate through the lines with
the arrow keys and insert any comments or additions. when finished, press escape and type: ':x' (sans single quotes) just type :x. What (:x) does just saves your changes and then exits you from vim. I'm just using this opportunity to make sure I can update this file but figured I'd include some information we can use.
