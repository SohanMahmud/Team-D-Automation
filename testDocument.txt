This is an example of creating a new text file through vim.
type the following: touch (filename).txt. in this example I typed:
touch testDocument.txt
this created the text document.
then I typed:
vim testDocument.txt
this opened up the vim editor and I was able to add this text by pressing 'i'
on the keyboard. When I'm done typing I will press 'esc' key and then I will
type the following:
        :x
again, this will save what I've typed into the text document and will exit the
vim editor. from here I can add the changes, commit the file, pull and then push.
I believe you absolutely must pull before you push after you make changes, but i could be wrong, otherwise I had an error.

git add .
git commit -m "created a new text document"
git pull
git push (I should no longer have to use '-u origin master' because you only
need to use that the first time you push, so just type 'git push').
